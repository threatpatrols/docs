# Threat Patrols Pty. Ltd.
Threat Patrols is an Australian cybersecurity company providing continuous SecOps for organizations seeking
additional cybersecurity capacity.  We develop and release some of our awesome tool-chains as well.

## Security.txt
We believe quick easy security contact information is an important part of cyber-security operations. We 
like the `security.txt` RFC9116 proposal and maintain a `.well-known/security.txt` HTTP record.

    HTTP: https://www.threatpatrols.com/.well-known/security.txt

Additionally, we maintain a `_security` DNS TXT record that references the same HTTP record.

    DNS TXT: _security.threatpatrols.com
